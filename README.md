Web Server - TCP Server

This Project Built as final project for Java, Design Patterns & Networking Basic Course.
The main idea of the project is to use Sockets & Threads to connect the client with the server.
The Methods we used in this applicaton:

- Display Folder Content from the server.
- Upload file to server from the client side.
- Download file from the server to the local client computer.
- delete file from the server.


sending requests from the clients with data thats server needs and
do the method that the user asked for then return response with body and response code to the client.
